<p><b>It is sometimes said that a sentence expresses a complete thought<b>.<br> This is a notional definition: it defines a term by the notion or idea it conveys.<br><i> The difficulty with this definition lies in fixing what is meant by a 'complete thought.'</i> <emp>There are notices, for example, that seem to be complete in themselves but are not generally regarded as sentences:<emp> <small>Exit, Danger, 50 mph speed limit...On the other hand, there are sentences that clearly consist of more than one thought.</small></p>
